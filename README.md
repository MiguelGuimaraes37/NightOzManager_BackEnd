# NightOzManager_BackEnd

This project was done in the context of a Hackathon and aims to help 2 people/groups of people to have a guide during the night out.

This guide works with questions throughout the night, as a meeting point for the group in case something goes wrong and even an SOS button, and other questions.

This repository is back-end only, here is the link of the front-end project -> https://github.com/MiguelGuimaraes37/NightofOzManager_FrontEnd.git.

Anyway, here's an image of the front end to satisfy your curiosity:

This project isn't 100% finished yet, so my hackathon team and I will continue to implement new features...
